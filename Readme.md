RPU is a procedural 2D and 3D scene definition language with integrated scripting and shaders. RPU is under active and early stages of development.

RPU utilizes a software renderer and is aimed at 2D and 3D content creation as well as rendering pretty pictures.

See below for examples.

## Goals

* Create 2D and 3D content for visualization or games by modeling with analytical and SDF primitives.
* Create procedural textures including material attributes and normals for both high-quality as well as retro experiences.
* Creating an ecosystem for sharing RPU content (materials, objects, scenes) via an integrated database.
* Render pretty pictures utlilizing various renderers.

## Non-Goals

* Although I will use RPU for rendering dungeons and scenes for my retro RPG creator [Eldiron](https://github.com/markusmoenig/Eldiron) it is not aimed at being a realtime renderer.
* RPU will output meshes for procedural 3D content but will not process them or model with meshes.

## Usage

You can use RPU in various ways:

* Edit RPU files with your favourite editor and use rpuc to compile them, view your content and save it to disk.
* An upcoming *RPU Creator* app will provide an integrated IDE for working with your RPU files featuring context help and live previews.
* Embed RPU source files in your app or game and create images live via the RPU crate.

## Not for Artists

RPU is meant as a tool for programmers and is not artist friendly by design. It is meant to be a tool which empowers developers to create their own art for their projects.
